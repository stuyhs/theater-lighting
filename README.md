# Murray Kahn Theater in Stuyvesant High Shool

The Theater currently has a nice complex and intricate lighting system. This repository pretty much contains documentation and materials on the system.

## Lighting Board

The booth currently holds an ETC Expression 3 board. This board is not in very good shape. It used to have a broken floppy disk, and some arse decided it would be a great idea to spill soda into it.

List of maintenance done:

* 2014 June 4 - Eugene Lee opened the board, replaced the floppy drive and verified it works, then cleaned out as much dust as possible, as well as use some rubbing alcohol to get some sliders and buttons to unstick.
